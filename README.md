# ToDo
First Commit

This is  simple Todo List App that  i made following a tutorial as im on my early stage of learning Javascript.
As the first commit we have the same as the tutorial, after that i will try to improve the app by adding functionalities or even creating a website around the app and add new apps to it. 

Second Commit

Solved a filter issue byt just removing one space in the HTML body in the ul tag.

Third Commit 

Created a separated array in the local storage to save the completed todos and show them in a different section, i hope in the future i can do it faster, i it took me 3 hours :(
